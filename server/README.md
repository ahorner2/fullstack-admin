# React-native MERN Stack Dash/CMS

Thanks @ed-roh!

## Features 

* Collapsable sidebar
* Redux async data handling
* Interactive charts, dropdowns, and nav
* Custom toolbar
* JS-rendered 

#### Misc Notes: 

- If using react-redux, @reduxjs/toolkit is required/
- Redux allows for global state storage, and changes to this state using reducers. 
  - These reducers are, more or less, functions that alter the state to its desired configuration.
- Redux also caches API calls, so if numerous components use the same data, only one call is made.
